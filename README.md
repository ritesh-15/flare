# ❤️‍🔥 Flare – A Dating App built with SwiftUI

Flare is a simple **dating app clone** built as a side project to explore and learn **SwiftUI**.  
After working mostly with **UIKit** for ~1.5 years, I wanted to dive into SwiftUI concepts, animations, and architecture patterns.  

So, since I wasn’t getting any matches on real dating apps (😭), I decided to build my own!

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **SwiftUI** – Beautiful UI and smooth animations  
- 🏗 **MVVM Architecture** – Clean & maintainable codebase  
- ☁️ **Appwrite** – Backend services for authentication & data handling  
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Support**  
- 🎞 **Custom Animations** for swipe, match, and transitions
